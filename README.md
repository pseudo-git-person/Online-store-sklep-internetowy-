# Online store (sklep internetowy)
Online store project developped for a hypothetical polish brand as a college task. Some of the variable names are in polish. Feel free to ask me any questions in case of confusion.

###The main functionalities are:
User registration and login;
Database of products with the ability to modify it in the browser;
Shopping basket;
Order mailling to a specified email address.

This repo includes a database dump "shop_db.sql" used in phpMyAdmin. It contains 3 tables necessary for this website to work in its full scope.

###This project is open source under the MIT license.
It is not commercialised and I do not receive any form of material gain from it's distribution.

Feel free to ask me anyquestions regarding it's contents.
